This is a three-level game teaching electrical circuit concepts. 

Possible extensions/customizations: make a circuit with ligthbulbs and speakers, make a circuit with an engine so when everything is in place the engine parts (wheels, gears, shafts, etc.) move, make a puzzle game with uploaded picture fragments, etc.
