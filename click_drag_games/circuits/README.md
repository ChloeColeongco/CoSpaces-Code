This is a three-level game teaching electrical circuit concepts. 

Possible extensions/customizations: make a circuit with ligthbulbs and speakers, make a circuit with an engine so when everything is in place the engine parts (wheels, gears, shafts, etc.) move, make a puzzle game with uploaded picture fragments (see menu icons on bottom left of space: Upload > Web Image Search or Upload > Image Upload), etc.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure your camera is set to Fly rather than Walk (default) so that you can adjust the Z position (height off the ground) to get the best view of the scene layout. Double click the camera item > click the second icon > click Fly
