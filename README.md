# CoSpaces-Code
JavaScript code for programs on CoSpaces VR platform - demos or templates so that it's easier to write interactive programs from scratch without knowing much JavaScript.

The CoSpaces programming environment may not render scenes reliably either on the website or the app due to the active expansion and updating of their API and the fact that itâ€™s a browser-based platform, however, for simpler beginner programs this should not be an issue.

This is a research project for the University of Alberta Computing Science Department High School Internship Program.
