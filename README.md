# CoSpaces-Code
JavaScript code for programs on CoSpaces VR platform - demos or templates so that it's easier to write interactive programs from scratch without knowing much JavaScript.

The CoSpaces programming environment may not render scenes reliably either on the website or the app due to the active expansion and updating of their API and the fact that itâ€™s a browser-based platform, however, for simpler beginner programs this should not be an issue.

Note on CoSpaces IDs:
Every created item and scene in CoSpaces has it's own unique item id.
You would need to access the ids of your item(s) and scene(s).
For items: double click item > click first icon > click copy id.
For scenes: click environment > copy id in top right corner of pop-up.

Note on CoSpaces getItem function:
getItem function assumes you have created an item directly in the scene to be accessed via id or name.
Setting item name: double click item > click second item > type desired name > make sure to hit enter to save changes.

This is a research project for the University of Alberta Computing Science Department High School Internship Program.
